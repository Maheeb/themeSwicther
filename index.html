      <h3>Computer programming</h3>
      <p>
        Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).
      </p>
      <p>
        The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs.
      </p>

      <h3>Why I love programming?</h3>

      <p>
        Coding something is more fun than using it. It's even better than playing games. Why? Learn how to program a computer and get the best games for free â€” your own. You're in total control. It's your idea, your logic, even your laws of physics. It's like building a house but without paying anything for the building materials. You can build a mansion for free.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get new inspiration for your next project, read the programs of others. This will give you an idea of how they think and how they solve problems. Many great programmers share their best code with you. You can do the same and share your project - or just the prettiest parts of it - with other programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's very appealing to work so hard on your vision that everything unnecessary peels off. All these little ideas and fundamental insights suddenly fall into place. What's remaining is the distilled truth, the result of an ambitious but rewarding thought process and when you write it down as a program you can see all the little pieces working together. This makes it so gratifying to figure stuff out on your own.
